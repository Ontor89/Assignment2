                <h2>'Esquire' Establishes New Position in Japanese Market</h2>
                <p>
                    The all-new Esquire was developed as a new choice, providing a spacious interior in a minivan. This new deluxe "compact cab wagon" is aimed to establish a new position in the Japanese market.The vehicle exterior has a stunning and powerful presence, from its front grille with a striking vertical emphasis that stretches all the way down to the lower bumper, to the plated finish on its door handles and back door. In the interior, it features synthetic leather with a metallic finish and stitching from the instrument panel through to the door trims. The "Gi" grade features a high-quality finish throughout, from the black wood grain finish on the steering wheel and shift knob, to full synthetic leather seat covers and a burgundy interior color scheme. In addition, a flat, low-floor package creates a roomy interior with outstanding ease of ingress and egress to ensure a high level of basic functionality, while also achieving environmental performance with class-leading fuel efficiency.
